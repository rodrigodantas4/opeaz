# Django project for Document Tree technical assessment (Phase 2 PoC).

Architecture decisions: [docs/adr/001-document-tree.md](docs/adr/001-document-tree.md)

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py test
python manage.py runserver
```

For manual API checks below, use a second terminal. All examples assume `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` and store the session in `cookies.txt`.

**Entity and node IDs** — SQLite auto-increment PKs change whenever you reseed. Do not hardcode values like `1` or `2`. Resolve IDs from the seed response or the test list endpoints, then export shell variables (examples below use `$PRIMARY_PHARMACY_ID`, `$CPC_ROOT_ID`, etc.).

| What you need | Where to get it |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Pharmacy / groupement / laboratory PK | `POST /test/seed/` → `primary_pharmacy_id`, `pharmacies[]`, `groupements[]`, `laboratories[]` — or `GET /test/pharmacies/` (and groupements/laboratories) |
| Tree node PK | Seed response → `nodes` (e.g. `cpc_root_id`, `vat_leaf_id`) |
| Session `entity_id` | Any valid PK for the chosen `entity_type` from the tables above |
| Move / share identity | **Session-first** when cookies are sent; optional body `owner_*` / `sharer_*` only when no session (PoC manual testing) |
| Share `target.entity_id` | Valid pharmacy PK when scope is `explicit` |

## Session entity context (PoC)

Tree **read** endpoints require an active entity bound to the Django session. Select it once, then send the session cookie on subsequent requests.

```bash
# Replace $PRIMARY_PHARMACY_ID with primary_pharmacy_id from POST /test/seed/ (or any pharmacy id from GET /test/pharmacies/)
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/session/entity/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_type": "pharmacy", "entity_id": '"$PRIMARY_PHARMACY_ID"'}'
```

Production would replace session keys with JWT claims; authorization (`TreeService.can_entity_access_node`) stays the same.

**Mutations (share / move):** when a session entity is bound, it is used as the sharer/owner and any body identity fields are **ignored**. Without a session, `sharer_type`/`sharer_id` or `owner_type`/`owner_id` in the body are accepted for isolated manual testing (see [PoC limitations](#poc-limitations)).

## API (base `/api/v1/`)

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `session/entity/` | Bind active entity to session |
| DELETE | `session/entity/` | Clear session entity |
| GET | `entities/tree/` | Aggregated bootstrap view (session required) |
| GET | `tree-nodes/{id}/children/` | List child nodes (session required) |
| GET | `tree-nodes/{id}/content/` | Resolve leaf content (session required) |
| POST | `tree-nodes/{id}/shares/` | Create share (session-first; body identity fallback) |
| GET | `tree-nodes/{id}/breadcrumb/` | Breadcrumb path (session required) |
| PATCH | `tree-nodes/{id}/move/` | Reparent node (session-first; body identity fallback) |
| GET | `media/{path}?expires=&sig=` | Signed file/image download (from content URLs) |

### Test / validation only (TODO — remove before production)

Available when `DEBUG=True` or during `manage.py test`. **Not mounted when `DEBUG=False`.**

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `test/laboratories/` | Paginated laboratories (max 50/page) |
| GET | `test/groupements/` | Paginated groupements (max 50/page) |
| GET | `test/pharmacies/` | Paginated pharmacies (max 50/page) |
| POST | `test/seed/` | Load assessment PDF example data (labs, groupements, pharmacies, trees) |
| GET | `test/tree-nodes/{id}/subtree/` | Full nested subtree from a node (session required) |

Query params: `?page=1`, `?page_size=50` (capped at 50). Seed: `?reset=false` to append without clearing (default `reset=true`). With `reset=true`, the endpoint wipes all labs/groupements/pharmacies/trees/shares, clears uploaded files under `media/documents/` and `media/flyers/`, clears the entity session cookie, and returns `cleared_before` row counts in the response.

---

## Phase 2 — step-by-step validation

Each section below maps to a **Decisions at a glance** row in the ADR. Run the shared bootstrap first, then follow the steps for each topic.

### 0 — Bootstrap (all manual checks)

```bash
# Load PDF example data (CPC, Nuxe, Bioderma, three pharmacies, full trees)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/test/seed/ | tee seed.json

# Optional: list entities to confirm pagination works
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/test/pharmacies/?page=1"

# Export IDs from the seed response (adjust jq paths if you parse seed.json differently)
export PRIMARY_PHARMACY_ID=$(jq -r .primary_pharmacy_id seed.json)
export CPC_GROUPEMENT_ID=$(jq -r '.groupements[0].id' seed.json)
export NORTE_PHARMACY_ID=$(jq -r '.pharmacies[] | select(.name=="Farmácia Norte") | .id' seed.json)
export CPC_ROOT_ID=$(jq -r .nodes.cpc_root_id seed.json)
export CONDITIONS_2025_ID=$(jq -r .nodes.conditions_2025_id seed.json)
export CONDITIONS_LEAF_ID=$(jq -r .nodes.conditions_leaf_id seed.json)
export VAT_LEAF_ID=$(jq -r .nodes.vat_leaf_id seed.json)
export MY_DOCUMENTS_ID=$(jq -r .nodes.my_documents_id seed.json)
export FLYER_LEAF_ID=$(jq -r .nodes.flyer_leaf_id seed.json)

# Bind session as Farmácia Central (primary_pharmacy_id from seed)
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/session/entity/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_type": "pharmacy", "entity_id": '"$PRIMARY_PHARMACY_ID"'}'
```

Save node IDs from the seed response `nodes` object if you are not using the `export` lines above. Replace `$…` placeholders in later steps with those values.

Automated regression for the whole PoC:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

---

### Q1 — Tree structure (adjacency list, lazy children, move)

**What to prove:** children are loaded per folder (not full tree at once); move updates `parent_id` without duplicating nodes.

1. **Lazy children** — CPC shared root should expose two folders, not deeper leaves:

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tree-nodes/$CPC_ROOT_ID/children/"
```

Expect names `Condições 2025` and `Flyers do agrupamento` (alphabetical). No `Condições gerais` or `Flyer Solares` here.

2. **Drill down** — load grandchildren:

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tree-nodes/$CONDITIONS_2025_ID/children/"
```

Expect one leaf: `Condições gerais`.

3. **Move node** — reparent the VAT leaf (session bound as Farmácia Central; no body identity needed):

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt -X PATCH "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tree-nodes/$VAT_LEAF_ID/move/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"parent_id": '"$MY_DOCUMENTS_ID"'}'
```

PoC fallback without cookies: add `"owner_type": "pharmacy", "owner_id": '"$PRIMARY_PHARMACY_ID"'` to the JSON body.

Expect `200` and `"parent_id": <my_documents_id>`. Re-fetch children of `Meus documentos` to confirm the leaf appears there.

4. **Cycle rejected** — moving a folder into its own descendant should return `400` (see `document_tree/tests.py` → `TreeNodeMoveViewTests`).

---

### Q2 — Polymorphic owner (Laboratory, Groupement, Pharmacy)

**What to prove:** trees owned by different entity types appear in one aggregated pharmacy view.

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/tree/
```

Expect roots/names from three owners:

| Name | Owner type | `is_owned` | `is_shared` |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| `Meus documentos` | pharmacy | `true` | `false` |
| `CPC` | groupement | `false` | `true` |
| `Nuxe` | laboratory | `false` | `true` |

Shared roots should include `shared_by.entity_type` (`groupement` or `laboratory`).

---

### Q3 — Sharing model (`NodeShare`, explicit + groupement_all)

**What to prove:** groupement share reaches all member pharmacies; lab share is explicit; descendants inherit access without extra share rows.

1. **Groupement_all (CPC)** — as Farmácia Central, `/children/` on `cpc_root_id` works (step Q1). Bind **Farmácia Norte** (another CPC member — use its `id` from `pharmacies[]` in the seed response, e.g. `$NORTE_PHARMACY_ID`) and repeat:

```bash
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/session/entity/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_type": "pharmacy", "entity_id": '"$NORTE_PHARMACY_ID"'}'

curl -b cookies.txt "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tree-nodes/$CPC_ROOT_ID/children/"
```

Expect the same two folders without creating a new share.

2. **Explicit lab share (Nuxe → Farmácia Central only)** — Central sees `Nuxe` in bootstrap; bind a pharmacy **outside** CPC membership (create via admin or DB) and confirm `403` with `"Entity does not have permission"` on Nuxe children.

3. **Create share** — bind session as CPC groupement first, then share (body identity not needed when session is set):

```bash
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/session/entity/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_type": "groupement", "entity_id": '"$CPC_GROUPEMENT_ID"'}'

curl -b cookies.txt -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tree-nodes/$FOLDER_ID/shares/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scope": "explicit",
    "target": {"entity_type": "pharmacy", "entity_id": '"$PRIMARY_PHARMACY_ID"'}
  }'
```

4. **Share validation** — groupement cannot share with a pharmacy outside its membership (`400`). Covered by `TreeNodeShareViewTests`.

5. **Full subtree (test helper)** — optional deep view:

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/test/tree-nodes/$CPC_ROOT_ID/subtree/"
```

Expect nested `children` down to `Condições gerais` and `Flyer Solares`.

---

### Q4 — Content polymorphism (Document, Flyer, CommercialCondition)

**What to prove:** leaf nodes resolve to typed payloads with signed file URLs where applicable.

```bash
# Commercial condition (shared CPC leaf)
curl -b cookies.txt "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tree-nodes/$CONDITIONS_LEAF_ID/content/"
# Expect: "content_type": "commercialcondition", "name": "Condições gerais"

# Document (owned pharmacy leaf)
curl -b cookies.txt "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tree-nodes/$VAT_LEAF_ID/content/"
# Expect: "content_type": "document", "file_url" contains "sig="

# Flyer
curl -b cookies.txt "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tree-nodes/$FLYER_LEAF_ID/content/"
# Expect: "content_type": "flyer", "image_url" contains "sig="

# Folder returns 400
curl -b cookies.txt "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tree-nodes/$CPC_ROOT_ID/content/"
```

---

### Q5 — Extensibility (new content types without TreeNode migration)

**What to prove:** adding a type (e.g. `Contract`) is an allowlist + serializer change, not a schema migration on `TreeNode`.

1. Inspect [`document_tree/validators.py`](document_tree/validators.py) — `ALLOWED_CONTENT_MODELS` and `validate_content_type`.
2. Inspect [`document_tree/serializers.py`](document_tree/serializers.py) — `CONTENT_SERIALIZERS` registry.
3. Confirm `TreeNode` uses generic `content_content_type` / `content_object_id` only ([`document_tree/models.py`](document_tree/models.py)) — no per-type FK columns.

No HTTP step required; this is a code-structure check aligned with the ADR.

---

### Q6 — Permissions and integrity (session auth, owner-only writes, soft delete)

**What to prove:** reads require session; unauthorized entity access gets `403` (`Entity does not have permission`); unknown nodes get `404`; mutations require owner context; deleted nodes are hidden.

1. **Session required** — clear cookie jar and call tree without binding:

```bash
rm -f cookies.txt
curl -c cookies.txt http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/tree/
# Expect: 401 Unauthorized

curl -c cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/session/entity/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_type": "pharmacy", "entity_id": 99999}'
# Expect: 400 (unknown entity)
```

2. **Access control** — bind a pharmacy with no shares and request CPC children → `403` with `"Entity does not have permission"`.

3. **Owner-only move** — bind session as a non-owner entity (e.g. laboratory) and PATCH move on a pharmacy-owned leaf → `400` “Only the node owner can move”.

4. **Soft delete** — `TreeNode` default manager excludes `deleted_at` set rows ([`TreeNodeManager.alive`](document_tree/models.py)). Restore/delete API is out of PoC scope; verify via Django admin or shell if needed.

---

### Q7 — Aggregated view (bootstrap: roots + first level only)

**What to prove:** initial load is shallow; deeper nodes require `/children/`.

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/tree/
```

**Included** (first level under each root):

- Own: `Meus documentos`, `Declaração IVA` (child of Meus documentos)
- Shared CPC: `CPC`, `Condições 2025`, `Flyers do agrupamento`
- Shared Nuxe: `Nuxe`, `Operação primavera`

**Excluded** (load via `/children/` instead):

- `Condições gerais`, `Flyer Solares`, `Brief de produto`

Confirm `CPC` has `"parent_id": null` and `"is_shared": true` even though groupement-owned.

---

### Q8 — API design (flat list, metadata, breadcrumb, ordering)

**What to prove:** flat JSON with `parent_id`; `is_owned` / `is_shared` / `shared_by`; siblings sorted by name; breadcrumb for navigation.

1. **Flat list** — bootstrap response is an array of objects with `parent_id`, not nested `children`.

2. **Breadcrumb** — path to a deep shared leaf:

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tree-nodes/$CONDITIONS_LEAF_ID/breadcrumb/"
```

Expect ordered names: `CPC` → `Condições 2025` → `Condições gerais`.

3. **Sibling ordering** — CPC children (Q1) return `Condições 2025` before `Flyers do agrupamento` (ASCII alphabetical by `name`).

4. **Read-only shared metadata** — shared nodes have `"is_owned": false`, `"is_shared": true`, and populated `shared_by`.

## PoC limitations

Intentional shortcuts for the assessment PoC. **Not production-ready** without addressing these.

| Topic | PoC behavior | Production follow-up |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| Session binding | Anyone can `POST /session/entity/` as any entity (no user login) | JWT/OAuth; real authentication |
| Mutation body fallback | Share/move accept body `sharer_*` / `owner_*` when no session | Session or JWT claims only |
| Signed URLs | Verified via `GET /api/v1/media/…?expires=&sig=` | S3 presigned URLs or CDN |
| Test routes | Mounted when `DEBUG=True` or during tests | Removed entirely |
| `permission` field on `NodeShare` | Schema only; not enforced | RBAC / read-write grants |
| Content vs tree owner | Not enforced (seed may cross-link) | Business rule in `TreeNodeService` |
| Orphan content on delete | Possible | CASCADE or cleanup job |
| Database | SQLite in dev | PostgreSQL + recursive CTE for breadcrumbs |
| Breadcrumb/subtree depth | Python walk capped at `MAX_DEPTH=20` | Recursive CTE at scale |

---

## Quick reference — seed node names (PDF example)

| Node | Owner |
|------|-------|
| Meus documentos → Declaração IVA | Farmácia Central |
| CPC → Condições 2025 → Condições gerais | CPC (groupement) |
| CPC → Flyers do agrupamento → Flyer Solares | CPC (groupement) |
| Nuxe → Operação primavera → Brief de produto | Nuxe (laboratory, shared to Central) |

Shares: CPC root → `groupement_all`; Nuxe root → explicit to Farmácia Central.

---
